                <p>Here's my dreams, in complete detail. Some of it may not make sense to anyone but myself. </p>

                <p> 3/25/20 I don't quite remember. Working out (I remember push ups faintly) was involved for some portion. But mostly, I'm very tired.</p>
                </p>
                <p> 3/26/20 Memory is still not full for any of the dreams, there were a lot. Tom hanks was in one of them (I think people kept teasing him about Coronavirus. I was working for PNC in another and up in a fancy penthouse where a butler delivered me new khaki pants in a bag (one of like three paris). Some workout stuff in these dreams as well. And there was some comparison dream where I kept going back forth between two options and one was clearly better</p>

                <p> 3/27/20 Had lots of dreams, many incldued all the siblings (probs because I had 3 hr video call with them). One dream I was hanging out with Clarke somewhere, potentially a different country, in a house I didn't recognize. But we were in a big living room with a window high up on the left side wasll and lots of white and a carpet. Higih ceiling. Mom was traveling ceperately, I had to leave for some reason early the next morning but I did't want to go. Wanted to do some fun thing for my final night there. Ben also had to go home too (somehow he got there with steph). Went to Ben's and he had a small party set up (that's why he needed to get home). I worked at Starbucks for like 1 shift (just training) to make some extra money and felt bad about leaving so soon but then I realized Covid would make it so the whole place was shut down anyway. Clarke and I went to this weird 'spa' where you just sleep for a super long time (We were in a dark, empty, finished, basement on large queen beds). I thinnk I woke up irl at this point and thats why the sleeping was included. Once we woke we were allowed to play N64 games in the basement on a projector. Mike B. and some other people started to show up to play games. I some how broke one of the controller cords very easily while unwrapping the controller (it was a grey controller obs). Later we were outside and all siblings were there. The spa was on large plot of country land with a small pong and forest in the back. Some siblings were out laughing in the forest. Ryan and I hung out by the house on the trampoline. I tried jumping but it was hard to get height (I felt old and unstable on it and not like I used to on trampolines). Then we had these weeeeeird slime pets that were like oysters that we had to complete random challenges with. I remember trying to grab the slime thing and it was gross, it felt like it was some how slightly biting me too. There were more dreams
                </p>
                <p> 3/28/29 HAd several dreams, only remember bits and pieces. One that was near the end. Took place some time in the not far future. I just got hired at a space company (large dark building in a rainy/ Gothamy city) and it looked like I would be going into space, or everyone thougth I would be, but I was a little nervous. Turns out their next mission was a pick up mission (some guy had to do a Matt Damon style leap to a space ship and return to earth). This dream lead into another one were I was in some strange beach area/town with rock towers (misty/foggy out) and was with people all going through some sort of training. Later on, I was attempting to provev that I can still use my mind to move things/ fly. Will Cotter was giving me encouragement over the phone and I eventually leaped up and floated to his snow covered roof.  Never sustained a good flight (realized I was dreaming because i knew I couldn't fly in real life and that made me sad). I did end up in space at one point. I was in a ship ( I think it was partially proppeled by my mind powers) and we were on a mission nudge an asteroid slightly out of its path so it wouldn't hit Earth. We reach the asteroid and perform the nudge, but realize that it is a spaceshsip looking thing. It doesn't do anything,but we freak out and head back to earth quickly. Oh also, Henry contacted me and said he had hear from Marc S. that I'd be staying with them in France, and I was a little confused and said yes i am going to France but I hadnt even asked them yet if I can stay with them.
                </p>
                <p> 3/29/20 I had da couple dreams but I can only remember the last one. I was Ryan Gosling, but I was an out of work doctor or actor, people called me "the doctor" but idk if I was a doctor. I lived with an israeli or middle eastern man, his  teenage son, and his wife. They were super nice. New York was really busy. There were some dystopian aspects but I can't remember what exactlty. I was talking with the family about how I would save up and move back to LA, but ti seemd really hard to do. We had like a calculator out and were calculating exactly how much money I could save up. This was during a dinner where we were all eating Burger King at a dinnger table with sun roof and candle light for lighting. It was warm/ summer time. There was also the cat, that was guarding a wad of singles/cash out side there house on a couch that sat outside their door. Earlier that day there was some weird social experiment going on at a Nintendo store where they had a Switch 3 and a nice Nokia camera out and there was some hidden disclaimer saying anyone could take them for free and walk out. These two young white women ended up talking one of them (it came in a box with a bunch of goodies including teal running shoes). Tried to ask why she took it but they left qucikly. There was like a town meeting outside the man's house. I was sitting with the cat (orange) and was lying on my back looking up at everyoen in a small circle. So I saw this older white woman from below and she had a strange face.  She was talking about how her mom had worked for the neighborhood for 30 years, but that her mom always warned people not to work for them too. The cat was orange. the couch was navy.
                </p>
                <p> 3/30/20 Several dreams again. I only seem to remember the last couple. I had to go to the hospital for something, I think allergic reaction, it was night time in some city - like Paris but everyone spoke English, Paris because that's what I felt and cause of the lights. I was discharged and given a free Epipen and told to use it if needed and went into a dark/empty/large waiting room where I found Colin Graham. He had just been discharged too and had three friends I didn't recognize there to meet him. We both were then in the dark room alone and he was on a childish looking laptop with like 3 massive buttons and a couple other small ones. I alughed at it and he rolled his eyes at the laptop clearly not happy with it. We were both waiting for people, didn't talk much to each other, but when I asked him how things were he said something like "noooot great". Then people started to show up and there was some TV/movie projected onto the wall. We all started to laugh and drink at some point. I think I shrunk to a tiny size and then became large. I was walking around the room. Don't remember much else.
                </p>
                  <p> 3/31/20 I know I dreamed but I don't remember them </p>
                  <p>4/2/20 I had several dreams, I remember a couple. Most involved drinking beer from a can. One was at a long house, potentially a rental (it later became owned by the Kuznickis and I had to move my car into their drive way and then back out later). But the first time I was there I was tired and Liza was there and so were a bunch of people all getting ready to party. And dad was on his way and when he pulled in Liza was super excited that he had come and rushed out to meet him. Different dream, I was in some 'parrty van' Like a party limo but it's a van filled with all young guys in suits. It was night time and the van stopped for some reason and we were on the sidewalk. And then we started trime traveling. It was like something meets the adult version of magic tree-house. We would get thrown back in time to some place we didn't know. And then we would have to complete a mission in order to jump back. Typically the time traveling occured when we jumped into a small pothole or puddle in a street (there were four guys, all ethnically diverse). Most of the 'missions' (they were never called that in the dream I'm just calling them that now) involved ending with some sort of duel. The last one was kind of renassaincy times and there was this tall, strong, old nasty woman and huge long sword and a tiny dog. Later there was this karaoke bar where the restraunt either had cameras at every table or someone set them up. a bunch of people were at the bar singing, including the Try guys, everyone kept looking into the camera and doing 'Jim' faces.</p>

                <p>Lots of Starcraft themes. First dream I remember I was in a room similar to Michael's room at Gigi's old place and we were playing team Starcraft IRL on the floor. Everything was miniature except us. I had two guys on my team. We started getting attacked by some zerglings, we were holding them off, but then this huge locust type swarm came in from the Zerg and flew in our faces, it was gross. Later on I had Just arrived back in MKE and went stragiht to Davids. David's dad was like working in barn fixinging it up. Zerglings started coming again, but more life size and I started throwing up canons, but they were taking too long to warp in. There were a couple women I didn't know at davids. David didn't seem to be there right then. The barn ended up getting swarmed </p>
